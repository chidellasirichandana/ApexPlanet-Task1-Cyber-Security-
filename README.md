# Internship Lab Report

*Company:* ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.  
*Intern ID:* APSPL2520241

***

## Objective

Build strong fundamentals in cybersecurity and networking using a private lab with Kali Linux and Metasploitable2.

***

## Setup Details

- *Lab Environment:*  
  - VMware Workstation used for virtualization  
  - Kali Linux (attacker) and Metasploitable2 (target) configured  
- *Tools Used:*  
  - Linux Terminal  
  - Nmap  
  - Wireshark  
  - Traceroute, Netstat  
  - Burp Suite  
  - Netcat

***

## Tasks Performed

1. *Virtual Lab Setup:*  
   Configured Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 virtual machines in VMware.

2. *Target Connectivity Check:*  
   Used ping command to verify Metasploitable2 is reachable on the network.

3. *Linux Fundamentals:*  
   Practiced navigation, file operations, permissions, and package management via Linux commands.

4. *Nmap Port Scanning:*  
   Identified open ports and services running on the target system using nmap.

5. *Packet Capture (Wireshark):*  
   Captured and filtered ICMP packets to analyze ping communication.

6. *Traceroute:*  
   Traced the network path to the target and listed all intermediary routers/hops.

7. *Netstat:*  
   Displayed active connections and network interfaces.

8. *Burp Suite:*  
   Intercepted and analyzed HTTP traffic for security review.

9. *Netcat:*  
   Demonstrated simple messaging/chat between Kali terminal1 & terminal2

## Notes (Short Theory)

- *Lab Setup:* Virtual machines allow safe, isolated cybersecurity experiments.
- *Ping:* Confirms device connectivity on the network.
- *Linux Commands:* Essential for managing files, permissions, and installs.
- *Nmap:* Scans for open ports/services to reveal network exposure.
- *Wireshark:* Analyzes traffic on the network for troubleshooting and learning.
- *Traceroute:* Shows all hops data passes through to reach a remote system.
- *Netstat:* Reports active network connections and status.
- *Burp Suite:* Inspects web traffic to find security issues.
- *Netcat:* Tests custom communications or quick file/message transfer.
